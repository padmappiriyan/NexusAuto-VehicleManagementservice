# AutoMobile Service Management System

This Service is a **Vehicle Management and Task Update System** built to streamline service center operations.  
It allows admins and employees to manage vehicle service bookings, track progress, and update task statuses efficiently in real time.

##  **Project Overview**

The system helps manage customer vehicle service requests from start to finish.  
Each booking goes through several stages — **Pending → Accepted → In Progress → Completed → Rejected**.

Employees can view their assigned tasks, mark them as completed once finished, and update the service progress easily.
